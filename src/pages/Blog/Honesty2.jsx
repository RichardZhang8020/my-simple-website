        <h1>Radical Honesty</h1>
        <br></br>
        <p>For most of my life, I suffered from crippling social anxiety. In high school, a teacher asked me to take a photo of their classroom
        for the end of the school semester. So I went to the front of the class to take some pictures. Being too anxious to give any signal, I 
        stood there awkwardly taking picture after picture to everyone's confusion. Eventually, the bell rang to my rescue. I gave back the phone 
        to one of the students which by that time had maybe 15-20 pictures. 'Wow you took so many pictures!' he noticed.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Another time, I was part of a business challenge
        where we had to make a group presentation. I prepared heavily for it, writing a script and rehearsing it again and again. I employed memory 
        techniques that I researched. 'Visualize a well-known place and in each room have a surprising image which reminds you of the sentence you want to remember. Then, come the time for your presentation, simply navigate through that well known place and you'll remember what to say!' Even before the presentation, 
        I would be nervously staring and rehearsing my script word for word while my other group members were doing no preparation. I would sit there
        wondering how they could ever be so relaxed. When it came time to finally do the presentation, I failed miserably. I said the first sentence, then
        the next, then - oops! - I forgot a single word and it completely derailed my train of thought. So I just awkwardly stood there saying absolutely nothing until one of
        my group members decided to skip over me and say their part.
        </p>

        <p>
        From these two examples, you can see how I knew my social anxiety was a huge problem. I tried to solve it again and again. Thinking there's a 'correct' way to talk, I read books 
        on how to get people to like me (ex. Dale Carnegie how to win friends and influence people). Smile more, ask questions, never talk about politics. 
        I would also note the exact things other people said as if I was adding their words to my arsenal that I could use in my future as a social mastermind.
        But none of these techniques worked. In retrospect, I most likely came out as fake, predictable and robotic. But above all, my social anxiety made me 
        deeply unhappy.  
        </p>

        <p>
        You might be wondering how any of this has to do with radical honesty. Well, for me, the lack of honesty was the dominant reason why I had social
        anxiety in the first place. My parents came from Communist China. And although they immigrated to Canada,
        they took along with them the ideas that were taught in China and passed them along to their children. Ideas like political correctness
        over truth. Politeness and presentation over authenticity. Lies over uncomfortable conversations. Growing up, we copy those around us and these beliefs
        become second nature. Much like how I'm sure my parents believed in these things because everyone around them also did, I grew up thinking the same 
        thing. But that doesn't change the fact that these ideas still lead to horrible outcomes. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Deep down, I think we all know that lying is bad. Everyone knows the awful feeling when they've been deceived. I definitely knew
        that lying was bad growing up, yet I would still do it. I would do it for the sake of politeness or culture or to theoretically protect
        other's people's feelings. I didn't lie for anything other than good intentions. I genuinely thought I was a good person for 
        saying the 'correct' words. Ironically, it was this very idea that there are correct words to say that was the cause of my
        social anxiety. I also made exceptions for 'white lies'. 'It's OK to lie for certain outcomes or small things!' In my mind, it was all grey. I thought lying is permissible depending on
        the situation. But with a caveat like that with no underlying principle, it really just meant I could lie whenever. It was a complete lack
        of moral clarity.   
        </p>

        <p>
        So what was the true solution to my social anxiety? <b>A principle of radical honesty</b>. To say the truth or say nothing at all. It's funny,
        all those rules that I thought were gold when I found them like smiling or asking questions - they all went out the window - and in their place
        is an effortless, simple rule to be honest in all situations. I feel smarter, natural and myself when I follow this principle. I speak clearly 
        because its a direct reflection of my thoughts. I use common sense over rules of social convention. When what I say is what I think, I'm  
        training my brain to remember the truth rather than a knockoff copy of it like in the form of a script. Without a doubt, I'm not perfect abiding
        by this principle of radical honesty, but I continually strive towards it.

        For a detailed logical breakdown of why we shouldn't lie, I recommend reading 'Lying' By Sam Harris. Also, here are my personal notes on 
        why we shouldn't lie. Thank you for reading!

        Why is lying bad?
        </h2>

        <blockquote>
            'I'm not upset that you lied to me, I'm upset that from now on I can't believe you.'
        </blockquote>

        <div className='reasons'>
        <p>
        When someone lies, you can't trust the other person. You're left wondering if anything the other person 
        says is actually true. Even watching someone lie to a third person reduces trust in your own relationship.
        </p>

        <p>
        Honesty forces you to live in reality. Being honest means you can't make up lies to cover up flaws you want to hide 
        or things you want to avoid. It provides real feedback from the world that you can use to grow. It also provides the same
        service to others when you are honest with them. You can only avoid reality for so long before it forces you to confront it.
        </p>

        <p>
        Authenticity is not possible without honesty. Authenticity means you're true to your own personality, values, and beliefs,
        regardless of the pressure to act otherwise. If you are constantly shifting your beliefs based off of circumstance, you
        are not being yourself. People are naturally drawn to people who are themselves!
        </p>

        <p>
        Lying is cowardice. We often lie to avoid an uncomfortable conversation or action. Eventually someone has to muster the courage to take
        responsibility and actually address the issue.   
        </p>

        <p>
        Lying is a refusal to cooperate with others. It's inherently deceptive. No wonder people get a lot more angry when 
        they're deceived rather than offended.
        </p>

        <p>
        Honesty is necessary for happiness. Being truthful attracts others that are truthful. It fosters meaningful conversations 
        and filters out all the bullshit. Speaking honestly is effortless because you are simply speaking your mind rather than remembering past lies to
        keep the act going. You can make real relationships with others and really trust them. Truth also enables comedy. When 
        people speak truthfully, life is funnier!

        <h2>
        Examples
        </h2>

        <p className="question">
        "If my child asks if Santa Claus isn't real, should I tell her the truth even if it dissapoints her?"
        </p>
        <p>
        Lying to your child only degrades the trust she has for you. It also messes with their understanding of reality believing that
        a person can travel across the world in a single night while breaking into every person's house to leave presents and eat cookies.
        Saying that Santa isn't real is no different than saying that faeries and mermaids aren't real. 
        </p>

        <p className="question">
        "My mom asks me whether or not I like the food she cooked? Do say I liked it even though I didn't?"
        </p>

        <p>
        Lying to your mom degrades the trust in your relationship with her. Even if you think she would get offended, it's her 
        responsibility to be able to handle negative feedback. Plus, you don't actually know how she will react. Lying also deprives your mom 
        of knowing what people really think of her cooking. 
        On top of that, lying could make the problem even worse. For example, 
        she might keep on cooking the same meal because she thinks you like it, in which case you would have to tell her the truth anyways. 
        She might even believe that her cooking is good enough to be on a cooking show, only to find herself harshly publicly criticized 
        in front of some honest judges!
