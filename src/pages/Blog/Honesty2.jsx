        <p>For most of my life, I suffered from crippling social anxiety. In high school, a teacher asked me to take a photo of their classroom
        for the end of the school semester. So I went to the front of the class to take some pictures. Being too anxious to give any signal, I 
        stood there awkwardly taking picture after picture to everyone's confusion. Eventually, the bell rang to my rescue. I gave back the phone 
        to one of the students which by that time had maybe 15-20 pictures. 'Wow you took so many pictures!' he noticed.

        Another time, I was part of a business challenge
        where we had to make a group presentation. I prepared heavily for it, writing a script and rehearsing it again and again. I employed memory 
        techniques that I researched. Visualize a well-known place and in each room have a surprising image along with the
        sentence you want to remember. Then, come the time for your presentation, simply navigate through that well known place and you'll remember what to say! Even before the presentation, 
        I would be nervously staring and rehearsing my script word for word while my other group members were doing no preparation. I would sit there
        wondering how they could ever be so relaxed. But when it came time to finally do the presentation, I failed miserably. I said the first sentence, but when 
        it came time to say the second, I forgot a single word and it completely derailed my train of thought. So I just awkwardly stood there saying absolutely nothing until one of
        my group members decided to skip over me and say their part.

        I always knew my social anxiety was a huge problem. I tried to solve it again and again. Thinking there's a 'correct' way to talk, I read books 
        on how to get people to like me (ex. Dale Carnegie how to win friends and influence people). Smile more, ask questions, never talk about politics. 
        I would also note the exact things other people said as if I was adding their words to my arsenal that I could use in my future as a social mastermind.
        But none of these techniques worked. In retrospect, I most likely came out as fake, predictable and robotic. But above all, my social anxiety made me 
        deeply unhappy.

        You might be wondering how any of this has to do with radical honesty. Well, for me, the lack of honesty was the dominant reason why I had social
        anxiety in the first place. My parents came from Communist China. And although they immigrated to Canada,
        they took along with them the ideas that were taught them in China and passed them along to their children. Ideas like political correctness
        over truth. Politeness and presentation over authenticity. Lies over uncomfortable conversations. Growing up, we copy those around us and these beliefs
        become second nature. Much like how I'm sure my parents believed in these things because everyone around them also did, I also grew up thinking the same 
        thing. But that doesn't change the fact that these ideas still lead to horrible outcomes. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Deep down, I think we all know that lying is bad. Everyone knows the awful feeling when they've been deceived. I definitely knew
        that lying was bad growing up, yet I would still do it. I would do it for the sake of politeness or culture or to theoretically protect
        other's people's feelings. I didn't lie for anything other than good intentions. I genuinely thought I was a good person for 
        saying the 'correct' words. Ironically, it was this very idea that there are correct words to say that that was the cause of my
        social anxiety. 
        </p>

        <p>
        I also made exceptions for 'white lies'. It's OK to lie for certain outcomes or small things. In my mind, it was all grey. Lying is permissible depending on
        the situation. But with a caveat like that with no underlying principle, it really just meant I could lie whenever. It was a complete lack
        of moral clarity.   
        </p>

        <p>
        So what was the true solution to my social anxiety? A principle of radical honesty. To say the truth or say nothing at all. It's funny,
        all those rules that I thought were gold when I found them like smiling or asking questions - they all went out the window. And in their place
        is an effortless, simple rule to be honest in all situations.
