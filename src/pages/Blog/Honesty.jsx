        <h1>The Case for Radical Honesty</h1>
        <p className='date'>June 3rd 2024</p>
        
        <p>
        Being honest is more important than any other aspect of a person. It's more important than being smart, hard-working or talented. 
        Yet everywhere you go, you encounter people that don't grasp it's importance. They say things they don't mean
        in order to protect other people's feelings. They say lies in order to shield innocent people from truths they cannot handle.
        They say what they think other people would want to hear in order to make them happy. In all of these examples I chose, the person has good intentions. 
        But it's these lies, lies that are based off of good intentions, that I believe are the most common and thus the most harmful. 
        I'm not saying that lying for your own self interest is any better. The vast majority of people already understand that lying in general is wrong. 
        But somewhere down the line in the so-called complexity do we reason that lying is permissible from situation to situation. And with a caveat like 
        that with no underlying principle, lying quickly becomes the norm. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Allow me to reduce the complexity:
        </p>

        <p className="centered-text">
        In all circumstances, lying is wrong. Adopt a principle of <span>Radical Honesty</span>. 
        </p>

        <h2>
        Why is lying bad?
        </h2>

        <blockquote>
            'I'm not upset that you lied to me, I'm upset that from now on I can't believe you.'
        </blockquote>

        <div className='reasons'>
        <p>
        When someone lies, you can't trust the other person. You're left wondering if anything the other person 
        says is actually true. Even watching someone lie to a third person reduces trust in your own relationship.
        </p>

        <p>
        Honesty forces you to live in reality. Being honest means you can't make up lies to cover up flaws you want to hide 
        or things you want to avoid. It provides real feedback from the world that you can use to grow. It also provides the same
        service to others when you are honest with them. You can only avoid reality for so long before it forces you to confront it.
        </p>

        <p>
        Authenticity is not possible without honesty. Authenticity means you're true to your own personality, values, and beliefs,
        regardless of the pressure to act otherwise. If you are constantly shifting your beliefs based off of circumstance, you
        are not being yourself. People are naturally drawn to people who are themselves!
        </p>

        <p>
        Lying is cowardice. We often lie to avoid an uncomfortable conversation or action. Eventually someone has to muster the courage to take
        responsibility and actually address the issue.   
        </p>

        <p>
        Lying is a refusal to cooperate with others. It's inherently deceptive. No wonder people get a lot more angry when 
        they're deceived rather than offended.
        </p>

        <p>
        Honesty is necessary for happiness. Being truthful attracts others that are truthful. It fosters meaningful conversations 
        and filters out all the bullshit. Speaking honestly is effortless because you are simply speaking your mind rather than remembering past lies to
        keep the act going. You can make real relationships with others and really trust them. Truth also enables comedy. When 
        people speak truthfully, life is funnier!

        Addressing Common Situations
        </h2>

        <p className="question">
        "If my child asks if Santa Claus isn't real, should I tell her the truth even if it dissapoints her?"
        </p>
        <p>
        Lying to your child only degrades the trust she has for you. It also messes with their understanding of reality believing that
        a person can travel across the world in a single night while breaking into every person's house to leave presents and eat cookies.
        Saying that Santa isn't real is no different from saying that faeries and mermaids aren't real. 
        </p>

        <p className="question">
        "My mom asks me whether or not I like the food she cooked? Do I lie and say I liked it?"
        </p>
        <p>
        Lying to your mom degrades the trust in your relationship with her. Even if you think she would get offended, it's her 
        responsibility to be able to handle negative feedback. Plus, you don't actually know how she will react. Lying also deprives your mom 
        of knowing what people really think of her cooking. 
        On top of that, lying could make the problem even worse. For example, 
        she might keep on cooking the same meal because she thinks you like it, in which case you would have to tell her the truth anyways. 
        She might even believe that her cooking is good enough to be on a cooking show, only to find herself getting harshly criticized publicly
        in front of some honest judges!
